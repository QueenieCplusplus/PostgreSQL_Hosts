hosts on Cloud, BaaS, and Virtual or Dedicated Server

* Server

    Most common way, howerver it costs time a lot to set up. It will be took place by below two ways.
    
    And server takes expensive requirements too, it needs 8 CPU/Terabyte Disks.
    
* Virtual Server

    It is a host on a host server. It seems a little bit like cloud, and it is building by ISP instead of builting on yourself. 


* Cloud & BaaS

  It is like the Vitual Server technically, but billing is different from them, virtual charge you monthly, and Cloud bill you in hours.
  
  As you would with a virtual dedicated server, you can install anything you want on it, manage permissions, remote into it, and sometimes add more disks or disk space, which is called Cloud Storage.
  
  Thus, you can add on, remove or scale up server  demand.
